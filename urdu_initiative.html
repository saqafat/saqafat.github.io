            <p>Pakistan's linguistic landscape is diverse, shaped by Indic, Iranic, Turkic, and Western influences. The native languages of Pakistan include Pushtu, Panjabi, Baluchi, Sindhi, Saraiki, Balti, Shina, Gilgiti, and several others. Urdu is the country's national language, however, it is not native to the land. Historically, Urdu was brought to Pakistan by the Muhājirs ( <span class="nastaliq tooltip-container">مهاجر<span class="tooltip"><span class="urdu-word"><span class="pronunciation">Muhājir (/mu-haː-jir/, <span class="nastaliq">مهاجر</span>)</span></span><span class="definition"><span class="details"><br>Meaning "immigrant" or "migrant."

At the forefront of this effort were the country’s most influential religious parties by far&mdash;Jamāat-e-Islāmī (JI) and Jamīat Ulemā-e-Islām (JUI)&mdash;both of which were founded and led by Muhājirs. These parties sought to define Pakistan as an Islamic state governed by Sharia law and worked actively to suppress any ethnic narratives, frequently labeling them as anti-Islamic.

            <p>Decades later, Urdu remains Pakistan’s official language. However, as a language introduced by Indian immigrants, it has largely alienated the majority of Pakistan’s native communities, who see it as foreign to their cultural and linguistic heritage. Efforts to align Urdu with Pakistan’s native languages by incorporating local elements have been rare and insufficient. Consequently, Urdu remains as disconnected from the land and its people today as it was at the time of its imposition. In fact, it has become even more detached through its rapid Anglicization. Research shows that English now constitutes up to 25% of casual Urdu speech,<a href="https://pjsr.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20.-Vol-3.-Issue-2.-June-2021-Channa-Kumar-Seelro-Quantification-of-Urdu.pdf" target="_blank" class="tooltip-container citation">[12]<span class="tooltip">Channa, Saleemullah; Kumar, Suneel; Seelro, Allah Dino (2021).

            <p>Replacing Urdu as Pakistan's official language is fraught with risks. The last serious challenge to Urdu’s status led to the 1971 civil war and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives—a path Pakistan cannot afford to tread again. A more pragmatic and peaceful approach to reclaiming our national language is to reform Urdu through a civilian-led effort, aligning it more closely with the linguistic heritage of Pakistan.</p>

            <p>A national language must reflect the collective identity and aspirations of its people. Turkey’s post-Ottoman language reforms serve as a compelling example. By removing Persian and Arabic loanwords from the Turkish language and adopting a Latin script, Turkey established a language that was uniquely its own and symbolized its new progressive identity. In contrast, the Pakistani state has failed to reform Urdu to align with the identity and aspirations of its people. Saqāfat seeks to fill this void by advocating for civilian-led language reforms.</p>

                <li> Anglicization of Urdu needs to be reduced (Hindi is heavily Anglicized, as much as 33%, and thus Anglicization is brining Urdu's vocabulary pool closer to Anglicized Hindi). If words have to loaned for technical and scientific terms, they should be loaned from French or other non-English languages.</li>
            </ol>
            The objective of Saqāfat's Urdu Initiative is to give Urdu a distinct linguistic identity and, in doing so, strengthen Pakistan's national identity. Currently, casual Urdu bears significant similarities to Hindi, partially because of the Anglicization of both languages, which has introduced a common pool of English vocabulary to both, and partially because Hindi has absorbed many standard Urdu words from its prominence in Bollywood. This overlap leads to the widespread perception of Urdu and Hindi as interchangeable, often seen in content such as YouTube videos or online recipes labeled as "Urdu/Hindi." This perceived interchangeability erodes Urdu’s distinctiveness and undermines Pakistan's cultural contributions on a global stage by associating them with India. Furthermore, Pakistan faces ideological threats from Hindutva and its Akhand Bharat narrative, which aims to undermine Pakistan's sovereignty and subsume its identity into a so-called Greater India. These external ideologies make it imperative for Pakistan to establish a distinct linguistic identity as a means to protect its cultural independence and sovereignty.
Moreover, tying Urdu too closely to Hindi binds Pakistan’s linguistic identity to India, undermining the rich ethnolinguistic diversity of the country and marginialing the country's Turko-Persian native groups and their linguitic heritage. This association undermines the inclusivity of Urdu as a unifying national language.-->
