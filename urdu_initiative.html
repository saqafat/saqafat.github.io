            <p>Pakistan's linguistic landscape is diverse, shaped by Indic, Iranic, Turkic, and Western influences. The native languages of Pakistan include Pushtu, Panjabi, Baluchi, Sindhi, Saraiki, Balti, Shina, Gilgiti, and several others. Urdu is the country's national language, however, it is not native to the land. Historically, Urdu was brought to Pakistan by the Muhājirs ( <span class="nastaliq tooltip-container">مهاجر<span class="tooltip"><span class="urdu-word"><span class="pronunciation">Muhājir (/mu-haː-jir/, <span class="nastaliq">مهاجر</span>)</span></span><span class="definition"><span class="details"><br>Meaning "immigrant" or "migrant."

This push for an Islamic identity, however, was also primarily championed by the Muhājirs, who, lacking ancestral ties to the land, strongly advocated for Pakistan’s national identity to be rooted in Islam rather than ethnicity. At the forefront of this effort were the country’s most influential religious parties by far&mdash;Jamāat-e-Islāmī (JI) and Jamīat Ulemā-e-Islām (JUI)&mdash;both of which were founded and led by Muhājirs. These parties sought to define Pakistan as an Islamic state governed by Sharia law and worked actively to suppress any ethnic narratives, frequently labeling them as anti-Islamic.

            <!-- <p>Efforts to align Urdu with Pakistan’s native languages by incorporating local elements have been rare and insufficient.

            </span>)</h1>

            <p>A national language should be a unifying force, embodying the collective identity and aspirations of a nation. Yet, in Pakistan, Urdu has been anything but. As a language brought in by Indian immigrants, Urdu's imposition alienated Pakistan’s native communities, their heritage, and their languages. It became a tool of exclusion, creating a divide between the ruling elite and the indigenous population. As a result, rather than fostering national unity, Urdu's imposition became a key catalyst of the 1971 civil war, which saw hundreds of thousands dead in its wake.</p>

            <p>But what is the way forward? Replacing Urdu is neither simple nor practical. The power structures that entrenched it as the national language would fiercely resist any attempt to alter the status quo, as history has shown.  More importantly, what would replace Urdu? Elevating any single ethnic language to national status would only deepen existing divisions, fostering further resentment among linguistic minorities. Additionally, the logistical and financial burden of replacing Urdu would be staggering, requiring billions to rework Pakistan’s education system, media, bureaucracy, and legal framework—an expense the country’s fragile economy cannot bear.</p>

            <p>A more pragmatic and effective approach is not to discard Urdu but to reform it—to reshape it in a way that aligns it more closely with Pakistan’s native cultural and linguistic traditions. Language reforms aren't new -- after the dissolution of the Ottoman empire, the new state of Turkey undertook significant reforms to its national language in order to align it with its new identity. However, unlike Turkey,  which sought to redefine itself in opposition to its imperial legacy through language reforms, Pakistan’s struggle is to define its identity in the first place. Therefore, Pakistan should under take Urdu reforms to not distance Urdu from its Persian and Arabic influences, as Turkey did, but rather to bring it closer to these influences to better reflect Pakistan’s native identity, situated at the intersection of Iranic, Turkic, Afghan, Indian, and Western influences. </p>
