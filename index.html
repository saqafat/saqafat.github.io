        <h2>Welcome to Saqafat!</h2>
        <p>Tired of hearing about Pakistani culture from everyone but native Pakistanis themselves? Exhausted by the government’s political spin marketed as "Pakistani culture," the clergy’s obsession with tying our ancestry to the Arabian sands, the urban Indo-philic liberal class in the UK and US that insists on labeling us as just "browns" or "South Asians," or the ever-dedicated Hindu-nationalist locusts next door, who curiously seem more interested in defining us than we are?
            This portal is my humble attempt, as a Pakistani civilian, to cut through these narratives and explore Pakistani identity from the perspectives of its people.</p>
